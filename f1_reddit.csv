1kq8v7a,2025 Emilia-Romagna GP - Day After Debrief,"Welcome to the Day after Debrief discussion thread!

Now that the dust has settled in Imola, it's time to calmly discuss the events of the last race weekend. Hopefully, this will foster more detailed and thoughtful discussion than the immediate post-race thread now that people have had some time to digest and analyze the results.

Low-effort comments, such as memes, jokes, and complaints about broadcasters will be deleted. We also discourage superficial comments that contain no analysis or reasoning in this thread (e.g., 'Great race from X!', 'Another terrible weekend for Y!').

McLaren did the right call to let Piastri and Norris fight at the end. They would have lost the time while swapping anyway and Lando wouldn't have catched Max. It was like Suzuka. They are consistent with their papaya rules."

mt4aupl,,,49,2025-05-19T08:33:36,,A___99,,t3_1kq8v7a,t3_1kq8v7a,"Leclercs early stop triggered a chain reaction that tricked so many into an early pitstop. I'm not sure why Sainz went so early. 


The Aston's and Russell would have needed to pit slightly earlier but not that much. Russell's tyres probably would have recovered a bit after the pace slowed once he wasn't pushing so hard to keep Norris behind. Alonso was reacting to Sainz, which is a bit unlike them as they usually go a bit longer. Stroll I have no idea what the plan was.


To me it seemed like McLaren thought they would need to try something different to beat Max, and the Leclerc undercut forced them to make a quick choice. They probably should have taken the safe option and let Piastri fall off the back of Verstappen and settle for a 2 3. Pitting behind so many cars you would need to overtake guarantees the same result at best but with a lot lot more risk. Seemed unnecessary"
mt5qruc,,,38,2025-05-19T12:54:30,,Starboard-Port,,t3_1kq8v7a,t3_1kq8v7a,"Outside of the 1st turn move, I've been thinking a lot about Max's 1st and 3rd stints. He pulled a decent 2-3 second gap on Oscar in the first 15 laps, and the RB's tyres and relative lap times held on much longer than the projected pit window. He certainly got fortunate with VSC, but the damage appeared to be already done. Then on the third stint, he pulled a 5-6 gap to finish the race, certainly aided by the tyre offset to Lando and Oscar, but that's a relatively large gap in 10 laps. Will be interested to see how the car performs on a normal race track (not Manaco) in dirty air and whether it'll be able to keep up with McLaren. I hope we have a true 3-way championship battle on our hands."

Max’s move was awesome i didn’t even see it coming until he already almost passed oscar. i really hope rbr actually made a huge step forward so that we can have a proper 3 way fight"

I'm going to miss it. Yes, it's too narrow, and there's only one real overtaking spot, and the pitlane is way too long. But it's a great flowing track in a lovely setting, and the fans are always excellent. 

Can't wait to find out which petrodome or street circuit will replace it. If we got Istanbul back, it wouldn't be so bad."
mt3yi0h,,,29,2025-05-19T07:16:11,,ghastlychild,,t3_1kq8v7a,t3_1kq8v7a,"I am going to go out on a limb and predict that some people here, in the future, will forget the importance of luck in races. You can absolutely put everything together but luck also has a small part to play in how your race is going to go. It is what I thought of when I thought about some of the drivers that got their opportunities squandered after the VSC, particularly Sainz

Williams is on a roll! Strong as hell qualifying and a formidable race. A lot could have gone differently, most notably Sainz pitting right before the VSC was thrown into the mix. But it is a good thing he managed to recover it fairly well, with the pace that he had. Albon himself had a strong race as well. Minus the incident with Leclerc and being caught in dirty air, I think there was a real possibility of him ending up in podium places. From an overview glance, this team in this season is such an improvement over the last, and years that followed. What JV has managed to do with the team is commendable, with two drivers that are able to challenge each other and a group of trustworthy personnel back in Grove to get the job done, they are ending their weekends on a solid and maximising on what they can *(all without upgrades considering development is going towards the FW48 but if the FW47's performance window maintains and they can keep themselves ahead, then hell yeah)*

Onward to the next few races! These results show promise and I am thrilled to see what else they have in store"

The only certainty I can think of is that after qualifying every team is gonna have to mandate a #1 and a #2 driver to make pit windows work and to not lose track position.

The McLaren conversation is gonna be an uncomfortable one particularly if they manage a front row lockout.

If I'm McLaren and I get a front row lockout, I'm having my P2 driver immediately drop back and open a 21 second gap (or w/e the pit stop gap is) so that my P1 driver can pit, then I'm swapping positions and having my driver that just pit slow everyone up to open a 21 second gap again so that the other car can pit, then repeat on the second set of pitstops but in the other driver order (because if you've followed so far, the driver who was in P1 after T1 is now in P2 and the other car is leading) to reestablish the turn one order. Then they can race. I'd ideally want both stops done by lap 40"

But, I'm interested to hear for this stat how they define 'the start'. Because, if it's 'lights out' then in the last race at Imola, Max didn't lead from the start, he lead from the second corner (great move btw).

Even if someone stalled at the start (not possible nowadays) the pole sitter would always be 'in the lead' for a time. Therefore, unless they define 'the start' differently to achieve a 'lead from start to finish' you must first be on pole.

On the eve of his home race, Charles Leclerc met with the Monegasque press, drawing up a very honest assessment of his 2025. The Ferrari driver did not hide his disappointment for the poor results obtained in the first seven events of the year, in which he collected only 61 points and a podium in the Jeddah race .



Leclerc: “We are not satisfied with the car”


Ferrari had closed 2024 by challenging McLaren for the Constructors' title until the final corners of the last Grand Prix of the year. The great design revolution involving the SF-25 should have allowed it to take that further step forward that the 2024 single-seater, now at the maximum of its development, would not have been able to guarantee.


So, at least for now, it has not been and from this point Leclerc's judgment on the current season starts: "" Clearly, it is negative . We are not at all satisfied with the performance of the car. Last year we ended the season fighting for the Constructors' World Championship. So we had a lot of ambition to try to win the title this year . We are fully committed to trying to recover the performance lost compared to McLaren and Red Bull in particular .""


The winter objective now seems compromised, considering the big gap in the general classification accumulated in these first months. On the horizon, however, is the Spanish GP, an event that could bring a small revolution in the values on the track: “ It is simply impossible for me to say that a good season would mean finishing fourth, third, etc. Honestly, I will believe it until the end ,” said Leclerc. “ Last year, we had an ultra-dominant Red Bull in the first seven races, and then a McLaren that recovered strongly. I hope we can have this kind of turnaround starting from Barcelona. In Spain, there will be a change to the technical regulation for the wings , which we have worked a lot on. It should be an advantage for us , but it remains uncertain. So we must win all the points possible until Barcelona .”


Monte Carlo: an encore is difficult, but…


While waiting for the possible breakthrough in Barcelona, there is the most expensive race for Leclerc to face. The Ferrari driver finally broke his personal curse last year, obtaining his first success on the streets of Monte Carlo.


A repeat this year seems very difficult, even if Leclerc leaves a small hope open: “ I am only aiming for the win. The podium is not something I particularly dream of. For several Grands Prix, our weak points have been the slow corners . Unfortunately, in Monaco, there is only this type of corner, so I expect a complicated weekend . At the same time, the circuit is so special and unique that we can hope that there is something in the car that we have not yet discovered and that will reveal itself here .”


Hamilton's Arrival: A Learning Opportunity


The big theme of the winter was the arrival in Maranello of Lewis Hamilton. The relationship with the seven-time world champion is very good and Leclerc remains convinced that the hiring of a driver with the experience of the British driver has been positive for him too: “ For me, nothing changes. It's a huge learning opportunity for me, because he's one of the legends of F1. But it's also a great motivation and an opportunity to show what I can do with Lewis at my side in the same car .”


Interesting is what Leclerc said about Hamilton’s characteristics from which he has learned the most so far: “ The discipline and his work ethic. Carlos (Sainz) was also a hard worker, but Lewis is a hard worker in a different way , and it’s really interesting to see the dynamics within the team. How does he handle problems? How does he comment on the car during development? It’s always interesting for every driver to be able to analyse how their teammate collaborates with their engineers .”


Among the positive aspects of working with Hamilton, Leclerc also mentioned the driving style: “ He is extremely talented, he has a very interesting driving style, which I can use myself in certain moments of the race , when it is the right time. We drive quite similarly. We both push on the corner entry. I think it is also quite positive for the team, because we have a clear and precise direction, towards which we are both aiming .”"

1ksu7es,"What’s a Mario Kart track that you think could work great for F1, either as it is or with a few adjustments?","One of my favourite tracks across the series is Mario Circuit from Double Dash and I think it could work kind of well for F1 with a good length put and back straight which could make for good DRS zones, it’s got some good elevation changes which I think would be fun to drive in a Formula car - the only thing I would change is to remove the mounds just after Turn-8, and obviously remove the chain chomp from the Turn-3 area. But overall, layout wise I think it could be fun to see racing here

Daisy Circuit from Wii is another circuit I’d find interesting in F1 - I would change the overlapping roundabouts to be more like Maggots & Beckets or the Suzuka Esses - it could also work with a complete straight and make that a DRS zone to add one other than the pit straight. It does also have the straight-hairpin-straight complex that Hanoi would have had and I think Sector 1 is an interesting sort of Monaco-esque feel to it

Also shoutout to Royal Raceway from N64 as that’s basically Silverstone mixed with Suzuka - remove the gap jump and make that a DRS straight and we’re golden to make it an F1 track",194,2025-05-22T10:53:28,/r/formula1/comments/1ksu7es/whats_a_mario_kart_track_that_you_think_could/,tm2007,117.0,,,

Road cars are easy to drive b/c they have a big heavy flywheels which make slipping the clutch and keeping the engine running very easy (regardless of the number of plates).  Race engines use ultra light flywheels (if they even have them at all) which when combined with a clutch that has a a very on/off setup makes it incredibly difficult to modulate and not stall the engine.

mtqg0go,,,1,2025-05-22T17:13:24,,ikergarcia1996,,t3_1ksxhvk,t3_1ksxhvk,"Many people are mentioning that very high torque makes these cars difficult to set off. This completely wrong. First of all, high torque makes the engine more difficult to stall. Second, the V10 Renault in the Top Gear clip has a torque of \~440 Nm at 16.000rpms. That is the same amount of torque as any German 2l diesel sedan, such a BMW 320d at 2000rpms.

This engine is powerful because it can operate at up to 19.000rpms, but it has a tiny amount of torque at low-rpms.

You really need very high rpms when releasing the cluch not to stall. Now image that you are sitting in a 900hp monster, which an engine that makes crazy sound, and that crashing it would cost millions of dollars in damage. And the engineer tells you ""Rev it to 9000rpms, and release the clutch"". Would yo do it? No, you would be scared of doing that because you know that the car will start accelerating too fast. So you would first try to use lower rpms and release the clutch slowly, which would make the engine stall."

Alpine fully expected to retain Alonso for another season  before putting Piastri in that seat and were trying to play Alonso’s & Piastri’s camps against each other to secure more advantageous contract terms, which is why they entered summer break 2022 with neither under contract for 2023. 

Otmar needed to throw Piastri under the bus to deflect from his own incompetence as Alpine TP. And now of course he doubles down on it. He has no integrity, is nothing more than an empty suit, and should never work in Formula 1 again.

mtptnlv,,,1,2025-05-22T15:19:01,,BobdaWalrus,,t3_1ksvf99,t1_mtplwf9,"Part Four:

Nor was the race itself a disappointment. As we sat on the terrace of the Hôtel de Paris, sipping Cinzano, we joined in the classic pre-event speculation: Who would come through first in that hell-for-leather opening lap? Moss, surely. Or Brabham. But which? The city hushed. The engines were started, a sound of sixteen angry lions. The starter began to count down. Off beyond our vision, a flag was dropped. The loudspeakers exploded, a babel of French and English lost under the thunder of accelerating machines. The street before us was empty. There was that long, delicious, agonizing, moment of suspense, then the ferocious sound of the cars as they rocketed up the hill and toward the hotel turn.

"" Is it Moss?""

"" Is it Brabham?""

Neither. The first car around, bellowing as it sank its fingernails into the cement, was a lo-slung, dark-blue BRM, and the driver was Sweden’s champion, Joakim Bonnier. Snapping at his heels was Jack Brabham, in a Cooper, and joined to Brabham was the Lotus of Stirling Moss. A few yards behind came the British dental surgeon Tony Brooks and the young ace whose career ended tragically a week later at Spa-Francorchamps. Chris Bristow. Then the rest of the pack. snarling and pushing. Baron Wolfgang Berghe Graf von Trips, known to intimates as Taffy, or von Crash, provided momentary horror as his Ferrari burst into flames. Von Trips might have evacuated the machine, but chose instead a different method. He went so fast toward Beau Rivage that the downrush of air simply blew out the fire. He continued in ninth place.

Meanwhile, Bonnier was building his lead. The BRM had a reputation for unreliability, but while it kept together it was a formidable machine. To anyone unfamiliar with its history of burst engines and broken suspensions, it must have seemed unbeatable. And so it was, for a great many laps. Then Moss decided it was time to stop hanging about. He passed Brabham and took after Bonnier. At the ten-lap mark, the bearded Swede led by just 0.8 second.

As if this were not exciting enough, races within races were going on back in the field. Phil Hill was whipping his immense Ferrari past car after car, and was now preparing to bull by Brooks. Little Richie Ginther, of California, had a handful with his rear-engine prototype, hut he was driving smoothly and the experimental Ferrari was ahead of several lighter, faster machines.

On lap seventeen Moss roared into the lead and began to pull away. Then Brabham passed Bonnier, and the stage was set for another battle of the giants. But Bonnier refused to cooperate. He went by Brabham and set off after Moss, who was now 4.7 seconds ahead. All three were traveling at an average speed which was considerably faster than the lap records of other years.

Then it began to rain. To the spectators this was a mild discomfort; to the drivers, a nightmare. The streets became spippery as oiled glass. A feeling of dread crept into the air, as the inevitable incidents started. Roy Salvadori went by his pits indicating that he would need a visor. Suddenly his Cooper slid out of control and collided viciously with the barriers at the Virage des Gazomêtres. Phil Hill tried to hang onto his brute arround the Casino bend, lost it, got it back somehow, and slithered on. Brabham the CarefuI was suddenly going like a madman. He got closer to Moss every lap, then, on the thirty-fourth, passed into the lead, which he began to stretch. Moss was expected to attack, but he did not. Perhaps he knew what was going to happen. It is difficult to explain otherwise how he was able to avoid disaster. For on the forty-first lap. Brabham spun. Moss came around Sainte-Dévôte to findthe lead Cooper revolving wildly. An accident seemed inevitable, but Moss gave the wheel a quick flick, missed the gyrating Cooper by millimeters, and went through. Brabham ended his race against the retaining wall

And still rained. Dark mist capped the terraced hills, turning the bright houses gray. We sat wondering now, with everyone else, if Moss had beaten his jinx. His lead seemed unassailable, yet –

On the sixtieth lap the dark-blue Lotus failed to come around. The crowd groaned. Moss was out of it, cheated again. But only for a few moments. He had had stopped at the pits when the power had begun to fail in his engine. A plug lead had come adrift. Moss replaced it himself and continued.
More incidents occurred. McLaren lost control of his Cooper, allowing Phil Hill and Graham Hill to catch up. Then Graham Hill lost his BRM, crashing into the Radio Monte-Carlo commentary box and all but demolishing the building – fortunately with no serious harm to anyone.

Now the rain slacked off. Moss turned a number of incredible laps below one minute 36.8, under the mistaken impression that he had only five instead of thirty-five to go, then settled into a steady winning pace. Bonnier dropped out, after a fine run. Gurney, never confident of the car, brought his BRM into the pits with broken suspension. Other machines limped in, like cripples, or stopped dead.

The spectators were all cheering for Moss, praying that nothing would happen to stop a well-deserved victory. Nothing did. The checkered flag fell on the dark-blue Lotus, and Stirling Moss won the Eighteenth Grad Prix de Monaco at 67.68 mph by 52.1 seconds from Bruce McLaren (Cooper-Climax), who was followed home by Phil Hill (Ferrari) and Tony Brooks (Yeoman Credit Cooper).

Moss was buried in roses. The little Lotus, which had gone so fast, sputtered around the city for its victory lap, and you could see only the roses and the driver’s happy smile. The G.P. was over. The sky turned gray, and the rain began to fall again in a silver mist. And all that was left of the danger and the excitement now were three broken rose petals, glowing red in the dark street.

But the festival was not yet completed. For now it was time for the traditional gala. The drivers went to their hotels, scrubbed the grease and oil from their skin, doffed their racing overalls, donned their soup-and-fish and scurried over to the Hotel de Paris. We joined them in the Empire Room, and marveled at the transformation that had taken place. No longer were they heroes and fools. They were young men having a spree. Deadly enemies only a few hours earlier, the pilotos were now gathered in wild camaderie on the dance floor of the elegant Empire Room, dancing mambos, trading partners, and generally having a hell of a time. Traditionally, the Prince and Princess joined the celebration, but they didn’t slow it down. The regal, ermine-cool Grace made an entrance out of The Prisoner of Zenda – slow drum roll, crowd standing at attention – but very soon she melted and joined the mad melee on the floor, which lasted until dawn.

They’ll be dancing there again this year. The streets will thunder again, and again there will be the thrill of speed, the joy of victory and the bitter challenge of defeat. Hard as it is to imagine, the festival will probably be greater than ever. Porsches will be joining the fray, Ferrari will have its super-light, 290-horsepower threat, and you may be sure the Coopers and Lotuses won’t be slower, and maybe the new rear-engine Scarabs will be ready. You can never be sure about Grand Prix racing."

ALO gained some speed on VER between Massenet and Casino (T4), but the most significant gain was inbetween Casino and Mirabeau (T5). At this point, VER was 0.146sec behind ALO.   
VER gained some speed on ALO between Mirabeau and the Hairpin (T6), but failed to make advancements at the Hairpin, second Mirabeau (T7), Portier (T8) and through the tunnel (T9). Worse, ALO had a better approach of Nouvelle (T10&11), carrying more top speed into Tabac (T12), where he also made a better approach with lifting later. VER was then, after Tabac and the end of sector 2, 0.204sec behind ALO.

One, Alonso had a poor final sector compared to the rest of the field in Q3, he did all his damage in sectors one and two. Two, while Verstappen did well to recover his deficit to Alonso, the next quickest driver was only a tenth slower, and it was Ocon of all people in an Alpine."

1kt089c,Remembering the *old* New Star GP,"Ten years ago, [a Reddit hero made a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/2y0wae/small_addictive_2d_f1_game_new_star_gp_is_now/) that would have great impact on my life. It was about this janky looking 2D (very unlicensed) F1 game called New Star GP that had recently become free to download.

If you've never heard of it, it's probably for the best. I downloaded that blessed game on a whim and sunk many, many hours into it over the following years. [Anyway, here's a quick preview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1GBx4XzqU). 

Despite its simple looks and mechanics, the game was actually pretty great. For starters, it had an amazing career mode which let you create a driver, start in any team, and then switch teams based on performance (or get dropped by your team owner, which locked you out of that run entirely. I called that Kvyat mode). The game was based on the 2010 season, so RB was always overpowered in the first year of career mode. Thereafter, constructors varied wildly in strength. Four seasons in you'd crush the competition in a Farce India. All driver and team names were customisable. As your driver amassed wins and titles, you could spend prize money on vehicles (sports cars, buses, tanks) which you could drive around a test track which was otherwise unaccessible. Oh, and if you bought vehicles for your friends, you could race ten buses against each other. 

Did you think ""Farce India"" was a typo? Remember the game was unlicensed. Other teams included Red Ball, Farrari and McLoren. They featured legendary drivers Sebostian Vuttel, Farnando Alinso and Lowis Himilton. 

Above all, the game was customisable enough that you seldom got bored. There was optional KERS, refuelling, tire changes, an insane damage toggle, and a slipstream feature which was absolutely overpowered. You could adjust the race length to anywhere between three lap sprints to hour-long endurance races. Some tracks were a cakewalk while some felt rigged against you. The pre-installed tracks were limited to the 2010 season calendar, but there was a track builder which let you create your own tracks one square at a time; gravel traps, advertisements, tire walls and all. In fact, there was a modding community which built and raced old tracks like the Nordschleife. Sadly I never understood how to import those into my game. 

To my great despair, New Star GP became unplayable once I upgraded my iOS one version too far. As in, the game would no longer open because it was incompatible somehow. It's been a few years now. Again, probably for the best. It was way too easy to procrastinate by thinking you were only going to play one quick round of career mode. Or maybe a season. 

I'll finally get to the point of this post. If you search New Star GP today, you'll be directed to this [new game, by the same creator, with the exact same name](https://www.newstargames.com/new-star-gp). It's probably good. I honestly haven't tried it. But it seems that this new game has replaced the old one entirely, meaning the original can no longer be downloaded. This is where I'm hoping to get some help. Surely in a community of five million, someone can point me to a link to the old New Star GP? One that will actually run? Maybe a knock-off variant which works on newer versions of iOS? 

If not, I'm hoping to at least reminisce with some of you about this wonderful little abomination of a game.",28,2025-05-22T14:55:21,/r/formula1/comments/1kt089c/remembering_the_old_new_star_gp/,im-a-new,11.0,,,
