mvb42fj,,,1,2025-05-31T16:03:51,,Miserable_Archer_769,,t3_1l05mu2,t3_1l05mu2,One of the times I enjoyed listening to Nico he was watching Lando and was calling out so many of his little errors and even said hes over thinking/driving the car
mvartgf,,,1,2025-05-31T15:00:52,,outer_bongolia,,t3_1l05mu2,t3_1l05mu2,"Left hander at the bottom of the hill was the difference maker. Lando had to make a correction because of a mini slide. He was never able to recover the time lost. 

They were both perfectly aligned otherwise."
mvbl4w8,,,1,2025-05-31T17:40:00,,f5en,,t3_1l05mu2,t3_1l05mu2,"The correction definitely did cost time in Landos lap, but I don't know if he would have had pole without the slide. Piastri put in the perfect lap with a very different approach. It's interesting to see their different driving styles in comparison. Lando carries more speed into the corner while Oscar is very focused on exit lines that allow him to apply as much throttle as possible. Could also explain why Oscar had trouble in Monaco which is basically the only track that would punish this. It looks like he found his way to push the new car and he tries it everywhere since he still has to learn about it.

Video also perfectly shows what Lando was talking about when he says that the characteristics of the new car don't suit his style. The older McLarens where basically build as midfield dive bomb machines and you can see that he still drives this way. Will be interesting to see if Lando can change his approach within a season."

mvbey7p,,,1,2025-05-31T17:03:47,,TheFlyingR0cket,,t3_1l05mu2,t3_1l05mu2,It's interesting that Lando always court Oscar into corners and Oscar always had a better run out of corners.

mvbnok6,,,1,2025-05-31T17:54:46,,68Snowy,,t3_1l05mu2,t3_1l05mu2,Commentary team said Oscar took a different line in first couple of corners to what he had been doing all weekend.  Gutsy to try something new when times are so close.
